# Dijet fit for CASE analysis


Based on previous VAE [version](https://github.com/jngadiub/VAEDijetFit)

### Prerequisites

Higgs combine tools is needed, either standalone or from cmssw. See [here](http://cms-analysis.github.io/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/) for instructions to get latest version.

### How To

The main fitting code is `dijetfit.py`.
It takes as input an h5 file with a branch of 'mjj', the dijet mass of events
to be fit. 
One also must supply a signal shape, a ROOT file that was outputted from
`fit_signalshapes.py`  or `interpolation.py`.
There are several other options for the fit as well, which are relatively
self-explanatory.
The fit automatically performs an F-test to determine if 2,3 or 4 parameter QCD
fit function should be used before doing the signal + background fit.
The outputs of the fit are saved in a json.

`fit_signalshapes.py` takes as inputs lists of h5's (all which have an `mjj` branch) and 
a corresponding list of signal massses. By default the signal shape is only fit
in the range of +/- 20\% of the signal mass (this can be changed with an option).
By default it uses a single crystal ball with a Gaussian core but we have been
generally using the double crystall ball fit (`--dcb-model` option). 

`interpolation.py` is used to interpolate signal shapes to different dijet
masses.
